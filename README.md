# Insult Bot
##### Where garbage code punishes garbage people!
A discord bot that uses a poorly made language model to generate insults. Because it is a general language model, it can output anything. I would encourage anyone messing with this to modify the language model in main.cpp (M_VAL and OUT_LENGTH) and swap out the training data with whatever you want.


## Getting Started
Create a discord Bot.

Clone the repo:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Carlos-sCreamyCoders/InsultDiscordBot.git
```
##### Make sure you have
 - python
 - c++ compiler
 - discord.py

To install discord.py
```
$ pip install discord.py
```
