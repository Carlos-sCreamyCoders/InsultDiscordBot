# Insult Bot
##### Where garbage code punishes garbage people!
A discord bot that uses a poorly made language model to generate insults. Because it is a general language model, it can output anything. I would encourage anyone messing with this to modify the language model in main.cpp (M_VAL and OUT_LENGTH) and swap out the training data with whatever you want.


## Getting Started
Create a discord Bot.

Clone the repo:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Carlos-sCreamyCoders/InsultDiscordBot.git
```
##### Make sure you have
 - python
 - c++ compiler
 - discord.py

To install discord.py
```
$ pip install discord.py
```
Make sure that your bot's token is in main.py, the last few lines have notes on how to do it.

Compile main.cpp and run main.py whenever you want the bot to be active.
